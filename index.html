    <p class="para">They met me in the day of success: and I have learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
      them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them further, they made themselves air, into
      which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who all-hailed me
      <span><q>Thane of Cawdor</q></span> by which title, before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred me to
      the coming on of time, with <span><q>Hail, king that shalt be!</q></span></p>

    <p class="para">This have I thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou mightst not
      lose the dues of rejoicing, by being ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.</p>

    <p id="closing">Lay it to thy heart, and farewell.</p>
